description: I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the energy and gas consumption across most areas of the Cooper Union building. Leveraging this data, I developed an Energy Dashboard that provides real-time visualization of energy usage from the Building Management System (BMS). Although I planned to integrate various machine learning algorithms to predict future energy consumption and carbon emission rates for the building, I could not proceed with this project because the contract between the school and the third-party company ended.
