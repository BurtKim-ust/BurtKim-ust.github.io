client: Research Intern at Cooper Union
category: Energy Dashboard Development
description: I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the energy and gas consumption across most areas of the Cooper Union building. Leveraging this data, I am currently developing an Energy Dashboard that provides real-time visualization of energy usage from the Building Management System (BMS). In the future, I plan to integrate various machine learning algorithms to predict future energy consumption and carbon emission rates for the building.
