  I and Tony Kwon developed a new type of computer operating system with Verilog codes. Our computer is built using 32-bit MIPS words featuring unique instruction formats.
  Rather than using common basic instruction formats, our computer runs based on the following basic instruction formats:
  
  R type: instr[31:26] = OP code, instr[25:19] = rs, instr[18:12] = rt, instr[11:5] = rd, instr[4:0] = shamt
  
  I type: instr[31:26] = OP code, instr[25:19] = rs, instr[18:12] = rt, instr[11:0] = immediate
  
  J type: instr[31:26] = OP code, instr[25:0] = address.
